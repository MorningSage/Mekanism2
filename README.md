# Mekanism Fabric

This is just a playground to test small additions to Fabric for the Mekanism Mod.  Most of the mod's content is not added...  As I port and want to test Fabric's way's of doing things, this is where I do it.  Code is likely to change, have bugs, and possibly copies of other people's code without crediting them just to get things to temporarily work.  It is not a reflection of what the final mod will look like. 

## Setup
